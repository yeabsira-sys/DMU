the server requires redis in memory storage engene to run
you have to go to your host.txt file and map admin.localhost 
cda.localhost, and stdportal.localhost to your local host ip address i.e 127.0.0.1
and run the email worker and auditlog worker functions manually from
the service directory in the src folder, 
this would work for now i am working hard to wrap up and work on swagger api documentation
